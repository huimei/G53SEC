In choosing a few typical security cases which illustrate the remarkable mentalities of my friend Sherlock Holmes I have endeavoured as far as possible to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism while fofering a fair field for his talents It is however unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal and a chornicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifce details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem or he must use matter which chance and not choice has provided him with With this short preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange though a peculiarly terrible chain of events It was a blazing hot da in August Baker Street was like an oven and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye It was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter Our blinds were half drawn and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa reading and rereading a computer generated letter which he had received by the morning post For myself my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold and a thermometer at 90 was no hardship But the morning paper was uninteresting Parliament had risen Everybody was out of town and I yearned for the glades of the Rew Forest or the shingle of Southsea A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday and as to my companion neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him He loved to lie in the very center of 5000000 people with his filaments stretching out and running through them responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime Appreciation of nature foudn no place among his many gifts and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil doer of the town to track down his brother of the country
